# Organizer (Pre-Alpha)

An android application to organize daily life modules. Currently, the application only manage "Money" module.

## Money Module

Soul purpose of this module is to keep track of daily expenses and balance.
### Account:
You can create Account to virtually split your money instead of real life account.
For example, one can create account "Wallet" to track his/her money in the wallet or bag. In the same way, one can create accounts "Travel", "Savings", "Medical" to distribute/categorize the money.
Benefit: One can have a clear idea of expendible money at some point and can reach to a goal of savings.
To create account, click ADD ACCOUNT button and fill up the account name, ammount and the background color for the account.

### Transaction & Categories:
After creating account, obviously there needs to be a way of transferring money, adding money to account and spend money. Clicking on an account will navigate to the account details and there will be a Transaction button. Clicking the button will initiate a transaction screen. Choose the type of transaction "Expense"/"Transfer"/"Income". Double click on the To account / From account will allow to select an existing account.

Besides amount, account and details, there is field named "Categroy" which is category of the transaction type. For example, one can spent money on Food, Dress etc. The same applies for income (salary, bonus etc). Unfortunately, there is currently no way to create a category in the time of transaction and there will be no pre-existing category and user needs to create them manually. The category needs to be created first. On the Money Manager screen, there is an icon button which will navigate one to category. Select a Transaction Type and click the + button at the bottom. Note that, the category will be created for the select transaction type and there is no way to select transaction type at the category creation screen.
